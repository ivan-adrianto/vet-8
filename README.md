# Vet Final Project Front End Team E
This is the final project assignment given by Glints x Binar Academy Batch 8. I collaborated with @honeycomb, @ririsayyu, and @angeliarb to create the front end side of the web app.

Vet is a web app that connect between pet owners and pet clinics. Through this app, the pet owners can book an appointment in desired pet clinic, as well as chat with the clinic admin.

The veterinarian can approve or reject any appointment requests created by user. After the pet checked, the doctor can move the appointment to user's history tab, after pushing "Finish" button. However, the veterinarian cannot register their account by themselves. They must be registered by a clinic admin where they work at.
The admin clinic can manage veterinarian that work in their clinic, both adding and removing veterinarian. The clinic admin can also check upcoming appointments in their clinic.

All users can update their profile, from personal info until their profile photo.

Note: The chat feature is still under development stage

##Enjoy, and stay safe everyone
